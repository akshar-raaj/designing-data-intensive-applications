A data store provides two major functionalities:
- Data storage
- Data retrieval

Even for an application developer, who is never going to implement his own **storage engine**, it makes sense to have a **rough idea** of the storage engine to **tune** it according to the **workload**.

Of the many families of storage engines, two worth mentioning are:
- Log-structured storage engine
- Page-oriented storage engine

## Log structure storage engine


## Page-oriented storage engine
