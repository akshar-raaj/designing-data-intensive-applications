## About

I recently started reading Designing Data-Intensive Applications. This repository has notes for different chapters.

## Data-intensive applications

Applications where data is the primary challenges. It could be in the form of:
- Volume: Amount of data
- Variety: Complexity of data
- Velocity: The speed at which data is arriving

**The enduring principles remain true irrespective of which data system we are dealing with.**

We discuss the **principles** and **trade-offs** that are fundamental to data systems.

This book has following chapters:

1. [Reliability, Scalability and Maintainability](./reliablility-maintainability-scalability/)
2. [Data Models and Query Languages](./data-models-and-query-languages/)
